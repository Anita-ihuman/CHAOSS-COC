In CHAOSS, we build metrics, software, and programs aimed at helping people better understand the health of the open source communities that they care about. As open source is now a critical part in nearly everything we do, understanding the health of open source communities is really important. Thanks for checking us out and we hope that the work we are doing is having a positive impact for everyone.
